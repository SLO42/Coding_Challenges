Make A Change Machine

Your task is to write a function to make a change machine, like this

const myChangeMachine = makeChangeMachine({ 1: 20, 5: 3, 10: 4, 25:3 });

This creates a change machines loaded with 20 pennies (one-cent coins), three nickels (five-cent coins), four dimes (10-cent coins), and three quarters (25-cent coins).

A change machine is a function that takes an amount and two functions as arguments, a success function, called if the amount is possible, with an object representing the combination, and a failure function, if the amount is not possible. The success function returns true if the combination should actually be issued

The following code shows some possible uses:

const myChangeMachine = makeChangeMachine({ 1: 20, 5: 3, 10: 4, 25:3 });

const error = () => console.log('Sorry, I cannot do that!');

const dump = combo => console.log(`
  ${combo[1]} pennies
  ${combo[5]} nickels
  ${combo[10]} dimes
  ${combo[25]} quarters`);

const picky = combo => {
  dump(combo);
  if (combo[1]) {
    console.log('Nope, I hate pennies');
    return false;
  }
  return true;
}

const easy = combo => {
  dump(combo);
  return true;  
}

myChangeMachine(131, picky, error);

// prints out 'Nope, I hate pennies'

myChangeMachine(131, easy, error);

// prints out
//  1 pennies
//  3 nickels
//  4 dimes
//  3 quarters

myChangeMachine(131, easy, error);

// prints out 'Sorry, I cannot do that!'
// because the previous call used up all but 19Â¢



Notice that the change machine is stateful.  It remembers when the function actually accepts the offered combination and when it doesn't.
